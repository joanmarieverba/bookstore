                <p>The third in the series, this story is just as fresh and exciting as the first two. The rescues, situations, and characters
                all include new things while remaining true to the feel of the Thunderbirds we remember. Read this book to your children,
                then show them the original: they, too, will become fans.</p>

                <p>I didn't fully realize what these books were about, until I remembered my youthful reading. They're Tom Swift for the twenty-first
                century. Suddenly, everything makes sense! If you liked Tom Swift (or The Shadow, or Doc Savage, or their many colleagues)
                this is more of it. Get 'em for your kids and grandkids.</p>

                <p> Virgil Tracy, the second of Jeff Tracy's sons, pilots the heavy-rescue craft, Thunderbird 2, which carries the specialized
                rescue equipment to the danger zone. In addition to his expertise as a pilot and engineer, Virgil is also a talented pianist
                and artist. Virgil's calm disposition serves him well in the extreme hazards that he faces as a member of International Rescue.
                In Deadly Danger, Virgil will have to draw on all of these skills to meet the challenges he faces: a California wildfire,
                a mine disaster in South Africa, a volcano eruption in the Pacific, an airliner in trouble, a town in Peru in danger of vanishing
                into a sinkhole, a bridge collapse in India, explorers in danger of grinding ice in the Antarctic. Most of all Virgil and
                his brothers and associates must find a warped genius who will stop at nothing to build and deploy a fleet of advanced machines
                to prove he is the greatest rocket scientist of the 2060s.</p>
