            Tragedy does strange things to people, and it is not always negative.
        
                <em>Countdown to Action!</em>
            
            is a novel based on the beginnings of the old television program Thunderbirds. When faced with his wife's death, Jeff Tracy
                calls upon his sons to create an organization dedicated to rescuing those who need it. Creating such an organization,
                however, is much easier said than done. 
           
                <em>Countdown to Action!</em>
            
            is highly recommended reading for science fiction enthusiasts in general and fans of the Thunderbirds television series in
                particular.

                <em>Countdown To Action</em>
            
            [is] a book to read and remember. It's also a thoroughly enjoyable, adventurous outing with characters who are beloved by
                fans around the world. The novel begins by filling in an element which has been largely neglected in Thunderbirds lore
                as it tells us about the relationship which brought those valiant Tracy brothers into our lives.
            
            My fascination with the series has always been more about what compels this amazing family to risk their lives time and time
            again, as well as about what in their collective background prepared them for their hazardous chosen task. Scott, Virgil,
            John, Gordon and Alan all had their own fields of study and interests outside of the family and were on their individual
            ways to gaining fame in their own right, away from their famous father's shadow. Countdown To Action illustrates in seamless
            order how Jeff Tracy raised five such selfless and brave sons to maturity, gifting the world with young men who were willing
            to sacrifice their own personal lives and safety to save those in mortal peril time and time again.
           
                <em>Countdown To Action</em>
            
            successfully delves into the formation of the core of International Rescue and so much more, making it a very satisfying
                introduction to an exciting new series.

            Thunderbirds has been my inspiration since childhood. This has been an enjoyable read and reliving of the characters and
            their history. I look forward to new adventures ahead as should fans old and new, too.

            Verba has created a humane and human background for these characters, with foibles and weaknesses believably overcome, which

            I have read the 3 books from the Thunderbird series and can honestly say once I read the first page I couldn't put it down.
            It kept me wanting more and looking forward to the next book in the series. Anyone who loves action books, would love the
            Thunderbirds Books. They are great for kids and adults. I passed them on to my grandson and he loves them also.

            My grandson loved your second novel. It took him only a week to read through it. He wanted me to drop you a line and say
            "WELL DONE." After he finished I read it to his younger brothers and he sat in to listen again. Amazing; he doesn't sit still
            very often. I see that you'll have a new one coming in 2010. Fantastic!!!!!! We can't wait to read this one also.

            I encourage you to order copies--they are wonderful books. If you are new to Thunderbirds, they will be an excellent introduction.
            If they Tracy family are old friends, you will find these stories deepen your understanding and enrich your memories. That's
            what good books are supposed to do. I'm delighted to have the chance to spread this fine work around, and to share something
            that has been very important to me. Something in the program resonated. The idea of selfless, honorable people devoting their
            lives to rescuing strangers, maybe. Or maybe it was the technology; nothing in Thunderbirds is what it appears to be. Swimming
            pools are rocket hangars, cars have machine guns, watches and powder compacts communicate with satellites. And Joan, I have
            to tell you, I've given away 18 books...so far. I'm getting emails back already about how much people are enjoying them.
            At least three parents told me they took the books out of the packages and read them before [giving them to their children
            to read].
