                <p>Thunderbirds has been my inspiration since childhood. This has been an enjoyable read and reliving of the characters and
                their history. I look forward to new adventures ahead as should fans old and new, too.</p>

                <div class="vspace">&nbsp;</div>
                <p>Verba has created a humane and human background for these characters, with foibles and weaknesses believably overcome, which
                makes their forming a brave, self-sacrificing force all the more credit-worthy.  FAB!</p>

                <p>After his wife dies in a tragic accident, astronaut Jeff Tracy is left with five young sons to raise. But he turns his grief
                into a dream: to create an organization which will rescue people that no one else can reach. He builds a business which creates
                the new technology that the organization will require and earns the billions he needs to finance it. At last, he is ready
                to put it all together. He enlists the services of a genius to design aircraft and supporting machinery far beyond the standards
                of his time. Together, they find a South Pacific island to use as the base of their operations. Then he asks his five sons,
                now grown, to give up promising careers to build the base, operate the machines, and serve in his organization. But he finds
                that in order to make his dream a reality, it will require sacrifice, courage, and determination...far beyond what he, or
                his sons, ever expected. Can they make International Rescue a reality, and what will it take to make the fabulous Thunderbirds
                machines GO?</p>

                <p><strong>Midwest Book Review: Small Press Bookwatch</strong></p>

                <p>Tragedy does strange things to people, and it is not always negative.
                <em>Countdown to Action!</em> is a novel based on the beginnings of the old television program Thunderbirds. When faced with his wife's death, Jeff Tracy
                calls upon his sons to create an organization dedicated to rescuing those who need it. Creating such an organization, however,
                is much easier said than done.
                <em>Countdown to Action!</em> is highly recommended reading for science fiction enthusiasts in general and fans of the Thunderbirds television series in
                particular.</p>
